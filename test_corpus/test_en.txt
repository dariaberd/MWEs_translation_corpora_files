The menu bar contains commands for managing plugins, managing and using bookmarks, refreshing the accessible tree view, and accessing this help system.
Accessible tree view
The accessible tree view allows to view all of the accessibles starting at the desktop level. Selecting an accessible makes it available for further inspection using the loaded plugins.
Right plugin view
This is one of the two default plugin views. When Accerciser is first run, most plugins will reside here. You can drag plugin tabs to the bottom plugin view or to the desktop to show two or more plugins simultaneously.
Bottom plugin view
You can drag plugins to or from this area just like the right plugin view.
Plugin View Management
Accerciser has two modes for viewing plugins. The current view mode could be toggled with ViewSingle plugin view or by pressing Controlt. When single mode is enabled, all plugins will be put in the top right plugin view and ordered alphabetically, this could be useful for screen reader users who have no use for Accerciser's flexible plugin spacial layout scheme. When single view mode is disabled plugin tabs could be dragged and dropped in to different plugin views, or could be dragged to the desktop to put the given plugin in a new view. The placement of plugins could also be manipulated with the plugin context menu that could be brought up either from the plugin tab, or the plugin preferences dialog.
Usage
You can use Accerciser to inspect any accessible widget shown in the tree view using the available plugins. The first step is to select an accessible to inspect using one of the following methods:
Select an accessible through the tree view.
Use the tree view to navigate the hierarchy of accessible objects rooted at desktop. Unfolding a tree node reveals its immediate children while folding it hides them. Each node shows an icon for its associated application or widget role and its accessible name, if available. The second column lists how many nodes will be shown if the item is unfolded.

Tells the receiving program that a debugger message ends here.
The debugger works by connecting to a TCP port for every time PHP 3 starts up.
All error messages from that request will be sent to this TCP connection.
Whereas applications written for the web are often executed very quickly, shell application tend to have a much longer execution time.
Because this setting is TRUE you will always have access to argc (number of arguments passed to the application) and argv (array of the actual arguments) in the CLI SAPI.
These directives cannot be initialized with another value from the configuration file php.ini or a custom one (if specified).
This is a limitation because those default values are applied after all configuration files have been parsed.

What is possible to send is: your country, region, locality, area, street, building, floor, room, and postal code, longitude, latitude and altitude, speed and bearing.
The accuracy and the quantity of information about your geographical position are based on the software or on the infrastructure used to discover your position.
Different kind of networks may have different accuracy settings, and may send different information. The use of external devices such as GPS or mobile phone will increase the accuracy of the information sent.
When the privacy mode is enabled, nothing more precise than your city will be sent, even if you are using an external device.
Who can see the information sent
Only your contacts can see your geographical position.
Group conversations permits you to have text conversations with more than one contact at the same time.
To have a group conversation you need to have a registered account with either Jabber or Google Talk, or a People Nearby account.
You can have a group conversation only with the contacts that are using the same service as yours.
You can hold private conversations with other IRC users, outside of the public IRC chat rooms. To start a conversation with another IRC user:
In the contact list for an IRC chat room, double click the name of the user you want to chat with. Alternatively, right click the name of the user and choose Chat.

Passing a filename with an absolute path information will not use the systems library search path.
A relative filename with a directory information will tell PHP only to try to load the extension relative to the current directory.
The first is the number of arguments plus one (the name of the script running).
You can decide whether or not you want a client disconnect to cause your script to be aborted.
Sometimes it is handy to always have your scripts run to completion even if there is no remote browser receiving the output.
Note that this assumes the use of the file upload name userfile, as used in the example script above.
Whether or not this overhead is really high depends on many factors. The bottom line is that if that connection overhead is high, persistent connections help you considerably.
They cause the child process to simply connect only once for its entire lifespan, instead of every time it processes a page that requires connecting to the SQL server.
This means that for every child that opened a persistent connection will have its own open persistent connection to the server.
For example, if you had 20 different child processes that ran a script that made a persistent connection to your SQL server, you 'd have 20 different connections to the SQL server, one from each child.
Note, however, that this can have some drawbacks if you are using a database with connection limits that are exceeded by persistent child connections.
This function is currently not documented; only the argument list is available.
Returns a string formatted according to the given format string using the given integer timestamp or the current local time if no timestamp is given.
If the database name is a number the system will use that as a port number and it will not ask FBExec for the port number.
This type of link is therefore called 'persistent'.
A special handling allows fetching "multiple field" columns (which would otherwise all have the same column names).
For each column of a "multiple field", the index name is constructed by appending the string "(n)" where n is the sub-index of the multiple field column, ranging from 1 to its declared repetition factor.
Total number of columns in result set (or zero if this was an "immediate "query).

Some problems are more common than others.
The most common ones are listed in the PHP FAQ, part of this manual.
If you are still stuck, someone on the PHP installation mailing list may be able to help you.
If you want to get help on the mailing list, please try to be precise and give the necessary details about your environment (which operating system, what PHP version, what web server, if you are running PHP as CGI or a server module, etc.), and preferably enough code to make others able to reproduce and test your problem.
If you think you have found a bug in PHP, please report it.
The initial PHP setup and configuration process is controlled by the use of the commandline options of the configure script.
This page outlines the usage of the most common options, but there are many others to play with.
Two types of installation are supported - standard, which provides sensible defaults for all the settings it can, and advanced, which asks questions as it goes along.
The installation wizard gathers enough information to set up the php.ini file and configure the web server to use PHP.
For IIS and also PWS on NT Workstation, a list of all the nodes on the server with script map settings is displayed, and you can choose those nodes to which you wish to add the PHP script mappings.
By and large, what is available has been made possible by the porting of necessary utilities from Unix.
Don 't be surprised if some of this heritage shows through from time to time.
Pretty much all of the instructions that follow are of the "set and forget" variety.
So sit back and try follow the instructions below as faithfully as you can.
To compile and build PHP To compile and build PHP you need a Microsoft Development Environment.
Microsoft Visuaul C+ + 6.0 is recommended.
To extract the downloaded files you need a extraction utilitiy (e.g.:
If you don 't already have an unzip utility, you can get a free version from InfoZip.
Notice how this is different from a script written in other languages like Perl or C - - instead of writing a program with lots of commands to output HTML, you write an HTML script with some embedded code to do something (in this case, output some text).
What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server.
If you were to have a script similar to the above on your server, the client would receive the results of running that script, with no way of determining what the underlying code may be.
Often you need classes with similar variables and functions to another existing class.
To facilitate this, classes can be extensions of other classes.
The extended or derived class has all variables and functions of the base class (this is called'inheritance 'despite the fact that nobody died) and what you add in the extended definition.
An extended class is always dependent on a single base class, that is, multiple inheritance is not supported.
You can still use normal cart functions on named carts: This is also called a "parent-child" relationship.
You can even use this new child class and create another class based on this child class.
This is particularly true if your derived class is a refinement or specialisation of code in your base class.
Instead of using the literal name of the base class in your code, you should be using the special name parent, which refers to the name of your base class as given in the extends Instead of using the literal name of the base class in your code, you should be using the special name parent, which refers to the name of your base class as given in the extends declaration of your class.
By doing this, you avoid using the name of your base class in more than one place.
Should your inheritance tree change during implementation, the change is easily made by simply changing the extends declaration of your class.
Each of these value types can be assigned into variables or returned from functions.
Each of these value types can be assigned into variables or returned from functions.
However, PHP takes expressions much further, in the same way many other languages do.
PHP is an expression-oriented language, in the sense that almost everything is an expression.
But the truth is that there' s one additional value involved here, and that's the value of the assignment itself.
The assignment itself evaluates to the assigned value, in this case 5.
Another good example of expression orientation is pre - and post-increment and decrement.
These are increment and decrement operators.
In PHP, like in C, there are two types of increment - pre-increment and post-increment.
Both pre-increment and post-increment essentially increment the variable, and the effect on the variable is idential.
The difference is with the value of the increment expression.
A very common type of expressions are comparison expressions.
These expressions evaluate to either 0 or 1, meaning FALSE or TRUE (respectively).
These expressions are most commonly used inside conditional execution, such as if statements.
But what if you want to add more than one to it, for instance 3?
In addition to being shorter and clearer, this also results in faster execution.
There is one more expression that may seem odd if you haven 't seen it in other languages, the ternary conditional operator:
The following example should help you understand pre - and post-increment and expressions in general a bit better:
In the beginning of the chapter we said that we 'll be describing the various statement types, and as promised, expressions can be statements.
However, not every expression is a statement.
In this case, a statement has the form of 'expr' ';' that is, an expression followed by a semicolon.
One last thing worth mentioning is the truth value of expressions.
In many events, mainly in conditional execution and loops, you 're not interested in the specific value of the expression, but only care about whether it means TRUE or FALSE.
When necessary, an expression is automatically converted to boolean.
See the section about type-casting for details about how.
PHP provides a full and powerful implementation of expressions, and documenting it entirely goes beyond the scope of this manual.
The above examples should give you a good idea about what expressions are and how you can construct useful expressions.
